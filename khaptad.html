                <p>
                    Khaptad National Park is located in the Far-western region
                    of Nepal.
                    The park was gazetted in 1984 covering an area of 225 sq.km.
                    The area
                    of buffer zone is 216 sq.km. The park is the only
                    mid-mountain national
                    park in western Nepal, representing a unique and important
                    ecosystem.
                    The late Khaptad Swami moved to the area in 1940's to
                    meditate and
                    worship. He spent about 50 years as a hermit and became a
                    renowned
                    spiritual saint.

            <p>The park offers a challenging yet rewarding experience unlike any
                other protected area in Nepal..
                The Khaptad Baba Ashram is located near the park headquarters.
                The Tribeni confluence made by
                three rivers, and a Shiva temple are on the way to Park
                Headquarters. Ganga Dashahara is
                celebrated here during Jestha Purnima and many pilgrims visit
                the park during the festival.
                Sahashra Linga is another religious site situated at 3,200 m
                above sea level which is the
                highest point in the park. Other religious places include Ganesh
                temple, Nagdhunga and
                Kedardhunga. These areas are considered as places for meditation
                and tranquillity and should
                not be disturbed. Tobacco products, alcohol, and sacrificing of
                animals are prohibited in
                these areas. There is a small museum and a view tower at the
                park headquarters. To the north
                one can see the Saipal Himalayan Ranges- In the other direction
                the vast green mid-hills of
                Nepal can be seen clearly. There are 22 open patches of Patans
                (pastureland) mix together
                with the forests inside park. The local people graze their
                livestock in the Patans during
                the summer season. In the north-eastern part of the park, there
                is a lake called Khaptad Daha.
